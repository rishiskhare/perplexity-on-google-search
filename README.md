# Perplexity on Google Search (Chrome Extension)

"Perplexity on Google Search" is a free Chrome extension that brings the power of Perplexity AI directly into your Google searches. Now you can get answers from both Google and Perplexity side-by-side with a single query‚Äîno more switching between tabs or typing the same question twice!

<b>NEW:</b> YouTube video summaries & support for Brave/DuckDuckGo search

## Key Features
- <b>Seamless Integration:</b> Automatically opens a Perplexity thread alongside your Google search results.
- <b>On-Demand Sidebar:</b> By default, access the Perplexity window via a dedicated button next to your search results.
- <b>Customizable Behavior:</b> Easily configure the extension to have the sidebar pop up automatically if you prefer.
- <b>Free to Use:</b> Enjoy full functionality at no cost. If you like the extension, give the repo a <b>star</b>! ‚≠ê

## How It Works
- <b>Search as Usual:</b> Enter your query in Google‚Äôs search bar.
- <b>Instant Answers:</b> A Perplexity thread automatically appears on the right side of your search results, providing a direct answer.
- <b>Enhanced Browsing:</b> View both Google‚Äôs results and Perplexity‚Äôs insights together, making your search experience faster and more efficient.

## (Aug 1) Update:
Unfortunately, this extension now continuously gives `www.perplexity.ai refused to connect.`. I believe that because I tagged Perplexity in my LinkedIn and X announcements, someone working there has patched this. Because of this, similar extensions have also stopped being able to embed `perplexity.ai` on the webpage or in a side panel. Therefore, I have unpublished this Chrome extension and will move on to other projects for the time being. I plan to soon archive this repo as well.

If you can get this to work with Perplexity's new update, please submit a PR! If not, it has truly been a pleasure to build and share this!

This extension has recieved overwhelming love from the r/perplexity subreddit. View my announcement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1lnyjjk/i_made_a_chrome_extension_that_brings_perplexity/). Within the first week since I posted, it has reached **1.4k downloads** üöÄ. Recently, it has even been **featured by the Chrome Web Store** üåü.

Although this is the end of this extension (for now), this has spurred more ambitious projects to build - to get involved, reach me anytime at rishiskhare@gmail.com.


## Installation
Get the latest version of this extension on the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perplexity-on-google-sear/mcpphmhblkibpbdalnocnnpmpfjleaha?authuser=0&hl=en).

## Sign-In Disabled ‚ö†Ô∏è
Right now, the extension is <b>100% free-to-use</b> and doesn‚Äôt have any <b>rate limits</b>.

Unfortunately, to keep it this way, the Chrome extension <b>won‚Äôt allow logging in with Google or Apple</b> because Chrome security counts this as a redirect. I honestly think it‚Äôs better this way to keep the Perplexity queries anonymous‚Äîso that pplx won‚Äôt associate your Google searches and YouTube video history with your account.

However, if you're somehow able to get it working, feel free to make a PR and I'll accept your change into the official code for the next release.
