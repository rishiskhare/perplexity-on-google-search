# Perplexity on Google Search (Browser Extension)

"Perplexity on Google Search" is a free Chrome and Firefox extension that brings the power of Perplexity AI directly into your Google searches. Now you can get answers from both Google and Perplexity side-by-side with a single query—no more switching between tabs or typing the same question twice!

<b>NEW:</b> YouTube video summaries & support for Brave/DuckDuckGo search

## Installation
Get the latest version of this extension on the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perplexity-on-google-sear/mcpphmhblkibpbdalnocnnpmpfjleaha?authuser=0&hl=en) and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/perplexity-on-google-search/).

## Sign-In Disabled ⚠️
Right now, the extension is <b>100% free-to-use</b> and doesn’t have any <b>rate limits</b>.

Unfortunately, to keep it this way, the Chrome extension <b>won’t allow logging in with Google or Apple</b> because Chrome security counts this as a redirect. I honestly think it’s better this way to keep the Perplexity queries anonymous—so that pplx won’t associate your Google searches and YouTube video history with your account.

However, if you're somehow able to get it working, feel free to make a PR and I'll accept your change into the official code for the next release.
